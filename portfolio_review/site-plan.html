        Homepage: Introduction and explanation
Hello, and welcome! The purpose of this three-page portfolio website is to showcase my progress and prowess while learning at Brigham Young University-Idaho. My name is Grant Miller, and I am studying to be a Graphic Designer with an emphasis in UX/UI, or user experience and interface. Essentially user experience and interface refers to the human interaction between product or application, and the quality therein. I have always enjoyed finding the balance in beautiful form and function, and pursuing a degree in Graphic Design has allowed me to learn and express those techniques.

	-Why will people come to your site?
		People will come to my website to peruse the effort and skills I have been learning to live by for these past two years. Besides curiosity and my advertising of the site, I will be posting the link to my Behance portfolio. The Behance portfolio is the required medium the Brigham Young University of Idaho school board asks for sophomores and juniors to submit once they are ready to take upper college level classes within the respective degree. It is required that I submit at least 6 examples of works/projects I have completed during my concurrent time learning.
	-What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
	I suspect that visitors will question the reasoning and purpose behind some of my artworks. Aside from most of them simply being exercises to improve my skills, I will give ample descriptions for each of the artworks I choose to display, and I will summarize simple questions such as: 1) What is the purpose? 2) What processes were used to complete it? 3) What materials/applications are present? 4) Was this in class, or personal?
	-What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
	Visitors will accomplish side-scrolling, expanding text boxes, zooming into artwork, maybe participate in demonstrative activities pertinent to the present artwork shown, and possibly checkbox/thumbs up and down projects.
	-What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
	Page numbers, numbered images, prompts, colored or bold type, page links, titles, hover information, possibly audio,
	-Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
Visitors outside of my initial circle of invitees will want to visit my website instead of others because I give a genuine and personal recount of my works. Most visitors will want to hear the author’s perspectival commentary and insight on their own artwork.

      <h3>Fine Arts</h3>
      <p>
        Page II: Fine Arts
Introductory paragraph on my experiences with pen, pencil, and other mediums while pursuing creative endeavors for my classes. Talk about my overall experience and upbringing in learning and wanting to be creative; kindergarten/high school art classes.
This page will hold the images and explanations of the physical artworks I have completed freshmen through sophomore year. The images are mostly from my Drawing I and Drawing II classes, but also possibly my Design and Color class, and my Introduction to Graphic Design class because there were some fine art elements that I did complete within them. Mediums include acrylic paint, charcoal, vine charcoal, graphite, and paper.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
        Page III: Graphic Design
Introductory paragraph on my interest and fascination with the interactions of people to product. I find satisfaction in form and function: “It looks pretty but it has its purpose”.
This page will hold the images and explanations of the digital endeavors I have taken on during my freshmen and sophomore years. The classes included here are Introduction to Graphic Design, Adobe Creative Cloud Basics, Graphic Design, and Typography I. Alongside those categories, I will also include images that I designed for personal expression outside of BYUI curriculum.
