    <p>Hello, hello, WDD 130! I am very intrigued and already hooked on working out the structures for html and CSS. I am a Graphic Design major with an emphasis in Ux/Ui and I am taking a minor in Web Design. I've been living here on the BYUI campus for just about 2 years now, but I've lived previously in Utah, Illinois, and Germany! I'd say Germany was my favorite place to grow up, because I was there for my beginning elementary schooling. For six years! I am second oldest to five wonderful sisters named Theron, Kate, Paige, Julliette, and Maggie, and they recently moved back to Germany with my parents, save Theron who is in Illinois.</p>
    <p>I am turning 21 in June, and have never been married. I currently work at one of the many Subway restaraunts to earn the odd hours whilst attending school. I enjoy reading medieval fiction, my favorite being the Ranger's Apprentice, I love to run and do sports such as Ultimate Frisbee, Spikeball, and Pickleball. I also enjoy cooking if and when I have the time, and also gaming if and when I have the time.</p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho, is the flexibility of the classes being able to be balanced with work and social life. I am progressing to complete my Bachelors in Graphid Design, and I see the advantages of taking this web design class towards my minor in Web Design. The two go hand-in-hand. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all of my life. I can't think of a specific quote, but my favorite talk is from Elder Uchtdorf's "Your Great Adventure" from the October 2019 General Conference.  </p>
